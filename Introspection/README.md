INTROSPECTION

(a) Why we must chose you? 
---


_I took biomaths in my higher secondary education,so i didn't know anything about coding or such things related to computer science until
i took CSE for engineering.When i came to know about python and using codeforces, i was very excited and happy to work it out and learn
more things about it.I am very enthusiastic to learn more about coding and coding languages, so i hope with the help of amfoss i can learn
more about such things.I also love to learn about tech based news and updates.My urge to learn more about programming languages and coding
can be taken as the main reason to choose me_.


(b) What is your plan for the next 6 months?
---

_I hope i can learn more about coding languages and will be able to solve more problems.I also hope to get good marks in my academics.
I aspire to get a good job in a top company.So i hope with the help of amfoss i will be to accomplish my goals_.


(c) How would you contribute back to the club?
---

_I will put my best effort to tackle all the problems that are thrown at me and will also try to share my knowledge with others.I will grab
the oppurtunities available at amfoss to enrich my knowledge and will try to upkeep the name of amfoss_.


(d) Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
---

_When i first read the tasks i was dumbstruck as i knew nothing about coding or related subjects.But when i started to do the tasks by googling 
and refering from here and there i found it exciting.It was really a good experience for a noob like me.I was able to learn something from it.
So i would say the selection process is very good_.
