INSTALL UBUNTU 20.04 [DESKTOP]
---

_This was the very first task that i did.I didn't even know what ubuntu was,so i googled about ubuntu and learned some things about it.
Then i watched an extensive video on youtube on how to dualboot ubuntu with windows.At first i didn't even understand anything,so i watched 
the video several times that day until i understood what all were the steps to do it.Since i didn't had a free usb device i had to buy one
and do the steps two or three days later.Finally i did my first task and found it easier to do than i thought.I was very 
happy:grinning::grinning::grinning:that day that i was atleast able to do my first task successfully_.
